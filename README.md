# Sudoku-solver-and-generator
This Python program can solve any sudoku but also generates new sudoku. It is the bare algorithm, therefore it has no UI and only outputs the calculated sudoku in the console. You can switch between solving and generation mode. The generation mode generates a very hard sudoku, which is just possible to solve and also prints the solution for it.

# What I learned
- This project was my first actual algorithm that I wrote
- I understood the basic idea of solving a complex problem using code

# Usage
- Go to the buttom of the file and change the array entries from 0 - 80 to the numbers representing the sudoku
- Leave a 0 if there is no number yet
- The numberration starts with the index 0 representing the top left corner of the sudoku and then goes left and down.
- change line
